### Pokemon Theme lyrics
```
[Verse 1]
I wanna be the very best
Like no one ever was
To catch them is my real test
To train them is my cause
I will travel across the land
Searching far and wide
Teach Pokémon to understand
The power that's inside

[Chorus]
(Pokémon
Gotta catch 'em all) It's you and me
I know it's my destiny (Pokémon)
Oh, you're my best friend
In a world we must defend (Pokémon
Gotta catch 'em all) A heart so true
Our courage will pull us through
You teach me and I'll teach you (Ooh, ooh)
Pokémon! (Gotta catch 'em all)
Gotta catch 'em all
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Every challenge along the way
With courage, I will face
I will battle every day
To claim my rightful place
Come with me, the time is right
There's no better team
Arm in arm, we'll win the fight
It's always been our dream

Our courage will pull us through
